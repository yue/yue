description: How to use Yue with Node.js and Electron.
---

# Getting started

Yue is a library for creating native GUI programs, by using its V8 bindings you
can easily build a desktop app with Node.js.

## Installing

The V8 bindings of Yue exists as the `gui` npm module.

### Node.js

Installing Yue in Node.js is as easy as:

```bash
npm i gui
```

But note that `gui` is a native module, you have to reinstall it whenever you
change Node.js versions or platforms.

Only Node.js v7 and above are supported.

### Electron

For Electron you must follow the [Using Native Node Modules][native-module]
guide on installing the `gui` module:

```bash
# Runtime is electron.
export npm_config_runtime=electron
# Electron's version.
export npm_config_target=1.8.0
# The architecture of Electron, can be ia32, arm or x64.
export npm_config_arch=x64
# Install the module, and store cache to ~/.electron-gyp.
HOME=~/.electron-gyp npm i gui
```

Only Electron v1.8.x and above are supported.

## Using Yue

Like other Node.js modules, Yue can be used with a simple `require('gui')`, but
depending on the runtime you use, there are some extra work to make GUI message
loop run.

### Node.js

Because Node.js was not designed for desktop apps, it is using libuv event loop
that is not compatible with GUI message loops.

In order to make GUI work in Node.js, you have to take over the control of event
loop by using the `MessageLoop` API, which would run native GUI message loop
while still handling libuv events:

```js
const gui = require('gui')

if (!process.versions.yode) {
  gui.MessageLoop.run()  // block until gui.MessageLoop.quit() is called
  process.exit(0)
}
```

To quit the message loop, you can call the `MessageLoop.quit()` API, which
would break the blocking `MessageLoop.run()` call and continue the script,
usually you should exit the process after that.

Note that this hack does not work perfectly, you should never use it in
production.

#### Yode

To solve the problem of incompatible event loop, you can use the
[Yode](https://github.com/yue/yode) project as a replacement of Node.js. Yode
is a fork of Node.js that replaces libuv event loop with native GUI message
loops, so there would be no need to use the `MessageLoop.run()` hack.

Unlike Node.js which would quit the process when there is no work to do, the
processes of Yode would keep running forever, until you call the
`MessageLoop.quit()` API to quit current message loop.

After quitting the GUI message loop, the libuv event loop is still running, and
the process will exit when all pending Node.js requests have finished.

The code example above also showed how to make the script run under both Yode
and Node.js.

#### Why other GUI toolkit bindings do not work

Having read so far, you might have understood why people were not using Node.js
for native desktop apps. This was because the design of Node.js natually does
not allow integrating the GUI message loops of native toolkits.

The only exeptions here are GTK+ and other X11 based toolkits, because
internally they use file descriptor based GUI message loops and can be iterated
with libuv.

So even though it is not hard to write V8 bindings for Cocoa or Qt, it is
impossible to run their message loops together with the event loop of Node.js.
The most common trick of keep iterating events of GUI message loops, results in
high CPU usage. While the trick used by Yue's `MessageLoop` API to replace the
event loop, has various problems with the events queue of Node.js.

Luckily with Yode the problem with message loop has been solved cleanly, even if
you are not intersted in Yue, it is still possible to use Win32 and Cocoa
bindings in Yode.

### Electron

Since the main process of Electron uses GUI message loops, there is no need to
use the `MessageLoop` API, and the `MessageLoop` API of Yue is not available
when running under Electron. You should always use the `app` API of Electron to
manage the process's message loop.

```js
const gui = require('gui')
const electron = require('electron')

electron.app.once('ready', () => {
  // Do work here...
})
```

## Example: Text editor

This example shows how to create windows and views in Yue, and how to manage
their layout.

Full code of this example can be found at
https://github.com/yue/yue-app-samples/tree/master/editor.

|  macOS            |    Linux          |  Windows          |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| ![][mac-editor]   | ![][linux-editor] | ![][win-editor]   |

### Creating a window

Each creatable type in Yue has a `create` class method can be used to create
instances of the type, constructors are not used because JavaScript does not
support function overloading while certain types can have multiple `createXXX`
class methods.

```js
const win = gui.Window.create({})
```

### MenuBar

With `gui.MenuBar` and `gui.MenuItem` APIs you can create menu bars, their
`create` methods also accept object descriptors to make the APIs easier to use.

By adding a menu bar, you can bind keyboard shortcuts to actions, and for some
very common actions there are also stock items can be used.

Note that macOS differs from other platforms that it has one application menu
instead of window menu bars, so your code should be aware of this difference.

```js
const menu = gui.MenuBar.create([
  {
    label: 'File',
    submenu: [
      {
        label: 'Quit',
        accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+Q',
        onClick: () => gui.messageLoop.quit()
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    label: 'Edit',
    submenu: [
      { role: 'copy' },
      { role: 'cut' },
      { role: 'paste' },
      { role: 'select-all' },
      { type: 'separator' },
      { role: 'undo' },
      { role: 'redo' },
    ],
  },
])

if (process.platform == 'darwin')
  gui.app.setApplicationMenu(menu)
else
  win.setMenuBar(menu)
```

### Content view

Each window in Yue has one content view, which fills the client area of the
window.

```js
const edit = gui.TextEdit.create()
win.setContentView(edit)
```

### Container and layout

The `Container` view can have multiple views and it can automatically layout
the child views according to the flexbox style properties assigned.

Following code creates a vertical sidebar on the left of the text edit view,
the sidebar stretches vertically and takes fixed width, while the text edit view
would fill all remaining space.

```js
// The content view has its children arranged horizontally.
const contentView = gui.Container.create()
contentView.setStyle({flexDirection: 'row'})
win.setContentView(contentView)

// The sidebar is a child of content view and has 5px paddings.
const sidebar = gui.Container.create()
sidebar.setStyle({padding: 5})
contentView.addChildView(sidebar)

// Make the sidebar have a fixed width which is enough to show all the buttons.
sidebar.setStyle({width: sidebar.getPreferredSize().width})

// The text edit view would take all remaining spaces.
const edit = gui.TextEdit.create()
edit.setStyle({flex: 1})
contentView.addChildView(edit)
```

### Vibrant view

On macOS views can be semi-transparent to show contents under the window, our
example makes use of this by using the `Vibrant` view for sidebar.

```js
let sidebar
if (process.platform == 'darwin') {
  sidebar = gui.Vibrant.create()
  sidebar.setBlendingMode('behind-window')
  sidebar.setMaterial('dark')
} else {
  sidebar = gui.Container.create()
}
```

### Buttons and HiDPI images

Following code creates image buttons without title, the `@2x` suffix in the
filenames of images means they have a scale factor of 2, and the images would
show without blur in HiDPI environments.

```js
// The buttons in the sidebar, they shows images instead of text.
const open = gui.Button.create('')
open.setImage(gui.Image.createFromPath(__dirname + '/eopen@2x.png'))
open.setStyle({marginBottom: 5})
sidebar.addChildView(open)
const save = gui.Button.create('')
save.setImage(gui.Image.createFromPath(__dirname + '/esave@2x.png'))
sidebar.addChildView(save)
```

### Dialogs

With `FileOpenDialog` and `FileSaveDialog` APIs, you can show system dialogs to
get inputs from users.

```js
save.onClick = () => {
  const dialog = gui.FileSaveDialog.create()
  dialog.setFolder(folder)
  dialog.setFilename(filename)
  if (dialog.runForWindow(win)) {
    fs.writeFileSync(String(dialog.getResult()), edit.getText())
  }
}
```

### Showing window

The events of types exist as properties of instances, to add a listener to an
event, you can call the `connect()` method of the event, or simply do an
assignment.

```js
// Quit when window is closed.
win.onClose = () => gui.messageLoop.quit()
// The size of content view.
win.setContentSize({width: 400, height: 400})
// Put the window in the center of screen.
win.center()
// Show and activate the window.
win.activate()
```

## Example: Float heart

This example shows how to use frameless window and how to draw things.

Full code of this example can be found at
https://github.com/yue/yue-app-samples/tree/master/floating_heart.

### Frameless and transparent window

By using the `frame` and `transparent` options, you can control whether a window
would have the native chrome, and whether the window is transparent.

```js
const win = gui.Window.create({frame: false, transparent: true})
win.setAlwaysOnTop(true)
```

### Dragging window

`View`s in Yue can be made draggable, so dragging the view would also drag the
window. In this example we make the whole window draggable.

```js
const contentview = gui.Container.create()
contentview.setMouseDownCanMoveWindow(true)
win.setContentView(contentview)
```

### Drawable area

While the `Container` view is mostly used for layout, you can also use it as
drawable area by using the `onDraw` event.

In the `onDraw` event an instance of `Painter` is passed, which can be used to
draw things directly on the view.

```js
contentview.onDraw = (self, painter) => {
  // Draw the shadow of heart.
  painter.setFillColor('#3000')
  drawHeart(painter)
  // Draw heart.
  painter.translate({x: -5, y: -5})
  painter.setFillColor('#D46A6A')
  drawHeart(painter)
}
```

### Painter

The `Painter` class represents native graphics context, it provides methods for
drawing. This example uses paths and bezier curves to draw a heart.

```js
function drawHeart(painter) {
  painter.beginPath()
  painter.moveTo({x: 75, y: 40})
  painter.bezierCurveTo({x: 75, y: 37}, {x: 70, y: 25}, {x: 50, y: 25})
  painter.bezierCurveTo({x: 20, y: 25}, {x: 20, y: 62.5}, {x: 20, y: 62.5})
  painter.bezierCurveTo({x: 20, y: 80}, {x: 40, y: 102}, {x: 75, y: 120})
  painter.bezierCurveTo({x: 110, y: 102}, {x: 130, y: 80}, {x: 130, y: 62.5})
  painter.bezierCurveTo({x: 130, y: 62.5}, {x: 130, y: 25}, {x: 100, y: 25})
  painter.bezierCurveTo({x: 85, y: 25}, {x: 75, y: 37}, {x: 75, y: 40})
  painter.fill()
}
```
