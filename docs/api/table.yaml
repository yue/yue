description: Table view.

detail: |
  The `Table` does not store any data itself, to display data in `Table`, users
  have to provide a `<!type>TableModel`.

  How data are renderered depends on the type of column. It is also possible to
  create a custom renderer for arbitrary data.

constructors:
  - signature: Table()
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: Create a new `Table`.

class_methods:
  - signature: Table* Create()
    lang: ['lua', 'js']
    description: Create a new `Table`.

class_properties:
  - property: const char* kClassName
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: The class name of this view.

methods:
  - signature: void SetModel(TableModel* model)
    description: Set `model` as table's data source.

  - signature: TableModel* GetModel()
    description: Return table's model.

  - signature: void AddColumn(const std::string& title)
    description: Add a new column with `title`, which shows readonly text.

  - signature: void AddColumnWithOptions(const std::string& title,
                                         const Table::ColumnOptions& options)
    description: Add a new column with `title` and `options`.

  - signature: int GetColumnCount() const
    description: Return the number of columns.

  - signature: void SetColumnsVisible(bool visible)
    description: Set whether the columns header is visible.
    detail: |
      On macOS adding column after hiding the header will result in missing
      columns in the header even after making the header visible again.

      It is recommended to never show the header again after hiding the header,
      for consistent behaviors between platforms.

  - signature: bool IsColumnsVisible() const
    description: Return whether the columns header is visible.

  - signature: void SetRowHeight(float height)
    description: Set the `height` of each row.
    detail: |
      It is not recommended to change row height unless you are drawing all
      cells yourself, as the default text cells may not show decently under
      large or small height.

      On Linux, due to platform implementations, this method has to be called
      before adding columns. It does not have any effect when columns have
      already been added.

  - signature: float GetRowHeight() const
    description: Return the `height` of each row.

  - signature: void SelectRow(int row)
    description: Select a `row`.

  - signature: int GetSelectedRow() const
    description: Return the index of selected row.
    detail: |
      For table that allows multiple selections, this will return the index of
      first selected row. When no row is selected, `-1` will be returned.
