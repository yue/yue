detail: |
  The `Notification` API is responsible for sending notifications, for handling
  events of notifications, the `<!type>NotificationCenter` API should be used.

  Before sending notifications, you should set app's ID and name otherwise the
  notifications may not be displayed.

  ```cpp
  auto* app = nu::App::GetCurrent();
  app->SetName("MyApp");
  #if defined(OS_LINUX) || defined(OS_WIN)
  app->SetID("org.yue.myapp");
  #else
  if (app->GetID().empty())
    LOG(ERROR) << "Unable to send notifications due to app not being bundled";
  #endif

  #if defined(OS_WIN)
  // Create start menu shortcut for testing.
  app->CreateStartMenuShortcut(nu::App::ShortcutOptions());
  #endif

  scoped_refptr<nu::Notification> notification = new nu::Notification;
  notification->SetTitle("Title");
  notification->SetBody("Message");
  notification->SetInfo("first-notification");
  notification->Show();
  ```

  ```lua
  gui.app:setname("MyApp")
  if (sys.platform ~= "macos")
    gui.app:setid("org.yue.myapp")
  else if (gui.app:getid() == '')
    print("Unable to send notifications due to app not being bundled")

  -- Create start menu shortcut for testing.
  if (sys.platform == "win32")
    gui.app:createstartmenushortcut{}

  local notification = gui.Notification.create()
  notification:settitle("Title")
  notification:setbody("Message")
  notification:setinfo("first-notification")
  notification:show()
  ```

  ```js
  gui.app.setName("MyApp")
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin')
    gui.app.setID("org.yue.myapp")
  else if (gui.app.getID().length === 0)
    console.error("Unable to send notifications due to app not being bundled")

  // Create start menu shortcut for testing.
  if (process.platform === "win32")
    gui.app.createStartMenuShortcut({})

  const notification = gui.Notification.create()
  notification.setTitle("Title")
  notification.setBody("Message")
  notification.setInfo("first-notification")
  notification.show()
  ```

  ## Platform requirements

  On macOS, only bundled apps can send notifications. To check if the app is
  bundled, you can check whether `<!method>App::GetID()` returns a non-empty
  string.

  On Linux, `Notification` is implemented by sending DBus messages following the
  [Desktop Notifications Specification](https://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/),
  the desktop environment must has a desktop notifications service running to
  show the notifications.

  On Windows, to display the notifications the app must has an AppUserModelID,
  and a shortcut on the start menu. For testing purpose, you can use the
  `<!method>App::CreateStartMenuShortcut(options)` API to create a start menu
  shortcut file.

  Also on Windows `Notification` uses toast notifications under the hood, and
  currently only Windows 10 and above are supported.

class_methods:
  - signature: Notification* Create()
    lang: ['lua', 'js']
    description: Create a new Notification instance.

methods:
  - signature: void Show()
    description: Display the notification.
    detail: |
      If the notification has already been displayed, calling this method again
      will update the contents of the notification. If the notification has been
      closed, calling this method will show the notification again.

      On Windows due to platform limitation, only the title and body of the
      notification can be updated after it has been displayed.

  - signature: void Close()
    description: Close the notification.

  - signature: void SetTitle(const std::string& title)
    description: Set the title of the notification.

  - signature: void SetBody(const std::string& body)
    description: Set the body text of the notification.

  - signature: void SetInfo(const std::string& info)
    description: Set the user info to be attached to the notification.
    detail: |
      When handling notification events with `<!type>NotificationCenter`, only
      the user info will be passed to the event handler.

  - signature: std::string GetInfo() const
    description: Return the attached user info.

  - signature: void SetActions(const std::vector<Notification::Action>& actions)
    description: Set the buttons to be displayed in the notification.
    detail: |
      The `<!name>on_notification_action` event of `<!type>NotificationCenter`
      will be emitted when user clicks one of the buttons.
    parameters:
      actions:
        description: An array of `<!type>Notification::Action`.

  - signature: void SetSilent(bool silent)
    description: Set whether to play sound when the notification is displayed.

  - signature: void SetImage(scoped_refptr<Image> image)
    description: Set the image shown in the content of the notification.
    detail: |
      Different platforms may choose to put the image in different places, there
      is no guarentee on where the image is placed.

  - signature: void SetImagePath(const base::FilePath& path)
    description: |
      Set the file path of the image shown in the content of the notification.
    detail: |
      This method is usually faster than reading a file from disk and passing
      its content to `<!name>SetImage`, so it is recommended to use this
      method over `<!name>SetImage` if the image is stored on disk.

      Different platforms may choose to put the image in different places, there
      is no guarentee on where the image is placed.

  - signature: void SetImagePlacement(absl::optional<std::wstring> placement)
    platform: ['Windows']
    description: Set the `placement` attribute of the image.
    detail: |
      The most common used `placement`s are `"appLogoOverride"` and `"hero"`.

  - signature: void SetHasReplyButton(bool has)
    platform: ['macOS', 'Windows']
    description: |
      Set whether to display an input field and a reply button in the
      notification.
    detail: |
      The `<!name>on_notification_reply` event of `<!type>NotificationCenter`
      will be emitted when user sends a reply in the notification.

  - signature: void SetResponsePlaceholder(const std::string& placeholder)
    platform: ['macOS', 'Windows']
    description: The the placeholder of the input field.

  - signature: void SetIdentifier(const std::string& identifier)
    platform: ['macOS', 'Windows']
    description: Set an unique `identifier` that can identifies a notification.
    detail: |
      When there is already a displayed notification with the same identifier,
      showing this notification will update its contents.

      On Windows due to platform limitation, only the title and body of the
      notification can be updated after it has been displayed.

      Note that there is no equivalent API on Linux, to update an existing
      notification's contents you have to keep the instance of the notification
      and call its `<!name>Show` method.

  - signature: std::string GetIdentifier() const
    platform: ['macOS', 'Windows']
    description: Return the unique identifier of the notification.

  - signature: void SetXML(absl::optional<std::wstring> xml)
    platform: ['Windows']
    description: Set custom XML of the toast notification.
    detail: |
      On Windows the notification can have rich contents and the Notification
      APIs do not cover all the possible features. In case you want to show
      some rich contents, you can use this API to set raw XML of the
      notification.

      You can find documentation on the XML schema and tools to generate XML
      at [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/adaptive-interactive-toasts?tabs=xml).

  - signature: std::wstring GetXML() const
    platform: ['Windows']
    description: Return the XML representation of the toast notification.
