name: View
description: Base class for GUI components.
detail: |
  `View` provides methods to receive and change various style properties.
lang_detail:
  cpp: |
    `View` is a `RefCounted` type. Sub-classes of `View` can only be created on
    heap, and must be managed with `scoped_refptr`.
    Every API that accpets `View*` will store a reference to the pointer, so it
    is safe to pass a newly created raw pointer to public APIs.

    ```cpp
    scoped_refptr<nu::Container> container = new nu::Container;
    container->AddChildView(new nu::Label("child"));
    ```

methods:

    detail: |
      The returned value is guarenteed to be the `kClassName` property of each
      view.

      For most platforms this method only works for frameless windows, having
      this feature may also prevent mouse events to happen.

      On macOS the `Container` view has this feature turned on by default. To
      turn this feature on for the view, the view's parent view must also has
      this feature turned on.

      On Windows the view with this feature will be treated as titlebar, e.g.
      double-clicking would maximize the window, right-clicking may show the
      system menu.

  - signature: bool IsMouseDownCanMoveWindow() const
    description: Return whether dragging the view would move the window.

  - signature: void SetFont(Font* font)
