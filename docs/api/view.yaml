  `View` provides methods to receive and change various style properties.

lang_detail:
  cpp: |
    `View` is a `RefCounted` type. Sub-classes of `View` can only be created on
    heap, and must be managed with `scoped_refptr`.
    Every API that accepets `View*` will store a reference to the pointer, so it
    is safe to pass a newly created raw pointer to public APIs.

    ```cpp
    scoped_refptr<nu::Container> container = new nu::Container;
    container->AddChildView(new nu::Label("child"));
    ```

class_properties:
  - property: const char* kClassName
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: The class name of this view.

methods:
  - signature: const char* GetClassName() const
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: Return the class name.
    detail: |
      The returned value is guarenteed to be the `kClassName` property of each
      view.

  - signature: Vector2dF OffsetFromView(const View* view) const
    description: Return offset from `view`.

  - signature: Vector2dF OffsetFromWindow() const
    description: Return offset from the window that owns the view.

  - signature: RectF GetBounds() const
    description: Return the position and size of the view, relative to its parent.

  - signature: void Layout()
    description: Make the view re-recalculate its layout.

  - signature: void SchedulePaint()
    description: Schedule to repaint the whole view.

  - signature: void SchedulePaintRect(const RectF& rect)
    description: Schedule to repaint the `rect` area in view.

  - signature: void SetVisible(bool visible)
    description: Show/Hide the view.

  - signature: bool IsVisible() const
    description: Return whether the view is visible.

  - signature: void SetEnabled(bool enable)
    description: Set whether the view is enabled.
    detail: |
      The enabled state of each view is not affected by its parent, disabling
      a container-like view does not have any effect.

  - signature: bool IsEnabled() const
    description: Return whether the view is enabled.

  - signature: void Focus()
    description: Move the keyboard focus to the view.

  - signature: bool HasFocus() const
    description: Return whether the view has keyboard focus.

  - signature: void SetFocusable(bool focusable)
    description: Set whether the view can be focused on.

  - signature: bool IsFocusable() const
    description: Return whether the view can be focused on.

  - signature: void SetCapture()
    description: Set mouse capture to the view.

  - signature: void ReleaseCapture()
    description: Release mouse capture if the view has mouse capture.

  - signature: bool HasCapture() const
    description: Return whether the view has mouse capture.

  - signature: void SetMouseDownCanMoveWindow(bool can)
    description: Set whether dragging mouse would move the window.
    detail: |
      For most platforms this method only works for frameless windows, having
      this feature may also prevent mouse events to happen.

      On macOS the `Container` view has this feature turned on by default. To
      turn this feature on for the view, the view's parent view must also has
      this feature turned on.

      On Windows the view with this feature will be treated as titlebar, e.g.
      double-clicking would maximize the window, right-clicking may show the
      system menu.

  - signature: bool IsMouseDownCanMoveWindow() const
    description: Return whether dragging the view would move the window.

  - signature: int DoDrag(std::vector<Clipboard::Data> data, int operations)
    description: Like `DoDragWithOptions` but do not set drag image.

  - signature: int DoDragWithOptions(std::vector<Clipboard::Data> data, int operations, const DragOptions& options)
    description: Start a drag session.
    detail: |
      The return value is a `<!type>DragOperation` indicating the result of
      dragging.

      This method should only be called in the `on_mouse_down` event, when user
      starts to drag the cursor.

      This method is blocking that it does not return until the drag session is
      finished or cancelled. During the call a nested UI message loop will run
      and other events will still be emitted.

      Note that on macOS certain views may have `IsMouseDownCanMoveWindow`
      defaulting to `true`, which will prevent drag session to start. Make sure
      to call `SetMouseDownCanMoveWindow(false)` for drag sources.
    parameters:
      data:
        description: |
          An array of `<!type>Clipboard::Data` that will be passed to drop
          target.
      operations:
        description: |
          Must be one or more of `<!type>DragOperation` masks, indicates which
          drag operations are supported.
      image:
        description: |
          The image that will show beside the cursor when dragging.

  - signature: void CancelDrag()
    description: Cancel current drag session if the view is being used as drag source.

  - signature: bool IsDragging() const
    description: Return whether the view is being used as drag source.

        description: An array of `<!type>Clipboard::Data::Type`.

  - signature: void SetCursor(Cursor* cursor)
    description: Set the cursor to show when hovering the view.

      color.

  - signature: void SetFont(Font* font)
    description: Change the font used for drawing text in the view.
    detail: |
      This methods only works for `View`s that display text, like `Label` or
      `Entry`.

    description: Change the color used for drawing text in the view.
    detail: |
      This methods only works for `View`s that display text, like `Label` or

    description: Emitted when cursor leaves the view while dragging.
    detail: |
      This event will also be emitted before the `handle_drop` event when user
      drops the data on the view.

    description: Emitted when the view's size has been changed.

  - callback: void on_capture_lost(View* self)

delegates:
  - signature: int handle_drag_enter(View* self, DraggingInfo* info, const PointF& point)
    description: |
      Called when user drags the cursor over the view for the first time.
    detail: |
      A `<!type>DragOperation` should be returned, indicating which dragging
      operation the destination will perform when cursor is released.

      This delegate will not be called if the view has not registered dragged
      types, or if the dragged data does not belong to the registered type.

      On Linux the dragged data is not yet available when this is called, you
      should usually only read data in the `handle_drop` delegate.

  - signature: int handle_drag_update(View* self, DraggingInfo* info, const PointF& point)
    description: |
      Called when user moves the cursor over the view while dragging.
    detail: |
      A `<!type>DragOperation` should be returned, indicating which dragging
      operation the destination will perform when cursor is released.

      If this delegate is not implemented, the return value of previous
      `handle_drag_enter` call will be returned.

      This delegate is usually used when implementing a custom view with
      multiple dropping areas, you only need to implement `handle_drag_enter`
      for simple tasks.

      On Linux the dragged data is not yet available when this is called, you
      should usually only read data in the `handle_drop` delegate.

  - signature: bool handle_drop(View* self, DraggingInfo* info, const PointF& point)
    description: Called when user releases the dragged data on the view.
    detail: |
      Returning `true` will inform the drag source that the data has been
      accepted with the drag operation returned by previous `handle_drag_enter`
      or `handle_drag_update` call.

      If the drag operation is `Move`, the drag source may also take actions
      to "remove" the data on its side.

      Returning `false` will inform the drag source that the drag has been
      cancelled, and operating system may display some visual effects.
