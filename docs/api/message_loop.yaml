description: Post events to main GUI message loop.
detail: |
  Depending on the runtime you use, Yue may or may not provide this API.

  Note that `MessageLoop` is a class instead of an instance, the APIs are
  provided as class methods. This is because the `MessageLoop` does not manage
  message loop, it just provides wrappers of system GUI message loop APIs.

lang_detail:
  cpp: |
    If you are using Yue in an environment that does not have its own event
    loop, you should use this API to enter message loop.

    ```cpp
    nu::MessageLoop::Run();
    ```

  lua: |
    This class can not be created by user, you can only call its class methods.

    ```lua
    local gui = require('yue.gui')
    gui.MessageLoop.run()
    ```

  js: |
    This class can not be created by user, you can only call its class methods.
