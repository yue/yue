    Users can implement a subclass of `TableModel` to feed `<!type>Table` any
    kind of data source. It is required to call the `Notify` methods in
    subclasses when data has been changed, so the `<!type>Table` can correctly
    update.

    For simple use cases, the `<!type>SimpleTableModel` can be used.

    For implementing a custom `TableModel`, please see
    `<!type>AbstractTableModel`.

methods:
  - signature: uint32_t GetRowCount() const
    description: Return how many rows are in the model.
    lang_detail:
      cpp: This is a pure virtual method, subclass must override this method.

  - signature: const base::Value* GetValue(uint32_t column, uint32_t row) const
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: Return the reference to the data at `column` and `row`.
    detail: |
      Caller should not store the return value, as it is a temporary reference
      that may immediately get destroyed after exiting current stack.

      This is a pure virtual method, subclass must override this method.

  - signature: Any GetValue(uint32_t column, uint32_t row) const
    lang: ['lua', 'js']
    description: Return the data at `column` and `row`.
    detail: |
      Note that the returned value will be stored as primary types, native
      objects (for example `Image`s) can not be passed to renderer.

  - signature: void SetValue(uint32_t column, uint32_t row, base::Value value)
    description: Change the `value` at `column` and `row`.
    lang_detail:
      cpp: This is a pure virtual method, subclass must override this method.
      lua: &setvalue |
        Note that the value will be stored as primary types, native objects (for
        example `Image`s) can not be saved.

  - signature: void NotifyRowInsertion(uint32_t row)
    description: |
      Called by implementers to notify the table that a row is inserted.

  - signature: void NotifyRowDeletion(uint32_t row)
    description: |
      Called by implementers to notify the table that a row is removed.

  - signature: void NotifyValueChange(uint32_t column, uint32_t row)
    description: |
      Called by implementers to notify the table that the value at `column` and
      `row` has been changed.
