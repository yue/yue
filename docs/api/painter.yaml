description: Graphic context.

detail:
  The `Painter` class can not be created by user, its instance can only be
  recevied in drawing events or via the `<!type>Canvas` class.

methods:
  - signature: void Save()
    description: Save the entire state of the painter.

  - signature: void Restore()
    description: Restore the most recently saved state.

  - signature: void BeginPath()
    description: Create a new path.

  - signature: void ClosePath()
    description: |
      Close current path and move current point to the start of current path.

      A straight line will be drew from current point to the start.

  - signature: void MoveTo(const PointF& point)
    description: Move current point to `point`.

  - signature: void LineTo(const PointF& point)
    description: |
      Connect the last point in current path to `point` with a straight line.

  - signature: void BezierCurveTo(const PointF& cp1, const PointF& cp2, const PointF& ep)
    description: |
      Add a cubic Bézier curve to current path.

      The first two points are control points and the third one is the end
      point. The starting point is the last point in the current path.

  - signature: void Arc(const PointF& point, float radius, float sa, float ea)
    description: |
      Add an arc to the path which is centered at `point` with `radius`
      starting at `sa` angle and ending at `ea` angle going in clockwise
      direction.
    parameters:
      point:
        description: Arc's center.
      radius:
        description: Arc's radius.
      sa:
        description: >
          The angle at which the arc starts, measured clockwise from the
          positive x axis and expressed in radians.
      ea:
        description: >
          The angle at which the arc ends, measured clockwise from the
          positive x axis and expressed in radians.

  - signature: void Rect(const RectF& rect)
    description: Add rectangle to current path.

  - signature: void Clip()
    description: Add current path to clip area by intersection.

  - signature: void ClipRect(const RectF& rect)
    description: Add `rect` to clip area by intersection.

  - signature: void Translate(const Vector2dF& offset)
    description: |
      Add translate transformation which moves the origin by `offset`.

  - signature: void Rotate(float angle)
    description: Add rotation transformation.
    parameters:
      angle:
        description: The angle to rotate clockwise in radians.

  - signature: void Scale(const Vector2dF& scale)
    description: Add scaling transformation to the painter.

  - signature: void SetColor(Color color)
    description: Set stroke color and fill color to `color`.

  - signature: void SetStrokeColor(Color color)
    description: Set the color used for shapes' outlines.

  - signature: void SetFillColor(Color color)
    description: Set the color used when filling shapes.

  - signature: void SetLineWidth(float width)
    description: Set the width of lines.

  - signature: void Stroke()
    description: Draw current path by stroking its outline.

  - signature: void Fill()
    description: Draw a solid shape by filling current path's content area.

  - signature: void StrokeRect(const RectF& rect)
    description: Draw a rectangular outline.

  - signature: void FillRect(const RectF& rect)
    description: Draw a filled rectangle.

  - signature: void DrawImage(Image* image, const RectF& rect)
    description: Draw scaled `image` to fit `rect`.

  - signature: void DrawImageFromRect(Image* image, const RectF& src, const RectF& dest)
    description: Draw the specified portion of `image` at `src` to fit `rect`.

  - signature: TextMetrics MeasureText(const std::string& text, float width, const TextAttributes& attributes)
    description: Measure the `text` with `attributes`, with maximum `width`.
    parameters:
      width:
        description: Maximum width, passing `-1` to indicate unlimited width.

  - signature: void DrawText(const std::string& text, const RectF& rect, const TextAttributes& attributes)
    description: Draw `text` with `attributes` bounded by `rect`.
