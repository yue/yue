  This class does system GUI toolkit intializations, and provides APIs around
  native GUI toolkit's application lifetime APIs. You should not use this API
  when integrating Yue into existing GUI apps.

  When using this class, you must create `Lifetime` before creating `State`.

constructor:
  - signature: Lifetime()
    lang: ['cpp']

      Create a `Lifetime` instance, you can only have one instance per thread.

events:
  - callback: void on_ready()
    platform: ['macOS']

      Emitted when received `applicationDidFinishLaunching` notification.

  - callback: void on_open(std::string fileURLPath)
    platform: ['macOS']
    description: |
      Emitted when received `applicationWillUpdate`. Emitted with a url string
      containing `file:///absolute/path/to/file` for each file that you `open
      with` using a program. Will be emitted multiple times through the lifetime
      of the program as files are opened during program run.

  - callback: void on_activate()
    platform: ['macOS']
    description: |
      Emitted when received `applicationShouldHandleReopen` notification and
