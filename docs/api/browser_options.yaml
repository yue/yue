      Depending on platform, the option to show devtools is usually in the
      context menu, so you should also enable builtin context menu when using
      this option.

      Currently this option is not working on Windows.

      On macOS due to the limitation of system APIs, right-clicking certain
      elements would still popup a menu with Services items.
